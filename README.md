# fluxnote
Fluxnote uses raw magnetic field strength data to detect rare-earth magnets within a specified boundary. It manipulates the Magnetometer API as implemented in Chrome 63 to calculate the polar coordinates of the magnet relative to a smartphone. Coupling this functionality with a magnetized stylus allowed for the creation of a completely paperless note-taking system.
